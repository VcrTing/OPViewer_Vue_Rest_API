### [What is VcrT?](https://github.com/VcrTing/VcrT_Vue_Rest_API)
        VcrT is an online photo storage center. 
        
        When users upload pictures to the platform, the platform can help users save the pictures/atlas.
        
### [What kind of scenes are appropriate?](https://github.com/VcrTing/VcrT_Vue_Rest_API)
        There are many suitable scenarios, but let me give you a few common examples:
        
        1, Sometimes you don't want to save this photo locally. 
        But it was difficult to get the picture again. 
        You wonder how great it would be to have a place to save your picture.
        
        2, Some photos are important to you. 
        You want to back up these photos, but packing them up for download can be cumbersome. 
        So you'd think it would be nice to have a more convenient platform to back up your photos.
        
### [What about protection of user privacy?](https://github.com/VcrTing/VcrT_Vue_Rest_API)
        We promise absolute confidentiality for user privacy. 
        
        Between the user and the user, the other party cannot know the information of the other party.
        and our background is unable to do follow-up operations on the content of the photos, 
        or to preview the content submitted by the user. 
        
        So, there are things you want to do on this platform.

        
### [Whether there is pressure during the operation of the site, and what the pressure is?](https://github.com/VcrTing/VcrT_Vue_Rest_API)
        Yes, the current picture is complicated, 
        the size of the picture is different, 
        the picture occupies different memory, 
        the picture type is different.
        we spent a lot of time to solve the problem of image differences.
